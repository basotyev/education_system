Topic - Python teaching system
a.
Nowadays programming is becoming one of the essential skills even though your field of
work or study is not related to it. Because of that, our team decided to choose a project, which
helps other people to study the Python programming language in an easy and fun way. We chose
Python language due to the reason that this language is considered as one of the easiest to learn
among other programming languages, since the code written on this language has clear and easy
to read syntax. Moreover, providing a coding interaction with the user is such a challenging part
for developers.
b.
First of all, the main competitor is Solo Learn online (https://www.sololearn.com/)
platform that is available as a web application and also as a mobile application (since it is available
in Kazakhstan, we decided to use them as an example too). There are several courses with the
variations of programming languages. Since it is free to study on this platform, we tried to take
several lessons by ourselves and we found out that all courses follow one pattern. First they give
you some theoretical materials and after that you should complete tasks like a quiz or fill the gaps.
Each course is divided into several parts like “Basic Syntax”, “Variables”, “Loops”, “Functions”
and etc. As a reward the system provides experience gathering with achievements.
Second one is Wunder.kz, which provides paid courses with theoretical parts and
assignments. The courses are simply represented as video materials. After each part, there is
homework. According to the watch list and submitted assignments at the end of a course the system
gives a certificate with an achieved level (Gold, Silver, Bronze).
In addition, there are decode.kz , knewit.kz that also have programming courses
online/offline. Nevertheless, the courses are paid and we cannot analyze a platform they are using.
c.
The main auditory for our project are people who want to start to learn programming.
Because nowadays IT is the most popular and most chosen profession. On top of that, IT
professionals are in demand in a market and they are paid very well, which means that they are
always new students for us. On the other hand, there will also be people who are already in IT, but
want to explore something new or just develop their skills. They will create the minority of the
auditory of our platform.
With the extended functionality(i.e. contester) the system may also be helpful for students
who are interested in ACM. With the following dashboard and achievements that will be a good
platform to compete.
d.
The main goal of our platform is to pass all the knowledge that we know to our students
and the second main goal is to make studying with us easy and fun. Consequently, the platform
should not be boring. If it is boring, it will be dull to study and we will just fail in reaching the
second goal. Because of that, we will try to create interesting tasks for our students. Moreover, we
are planning to create a gamification side of our application to motivate users to study(achievements system maybe) and as an experimental part, we want to add a contester with
different tasks and a dashboard with the best users, who solved tasks from contester. As a
knowledge check-up we may assume real python assignments, or “fill the gaps” or quizzes. In
addition, the design of the platform will also be user-friendly and eye-catching, so the students
will not face any problems in navigating or completing the tasks.
The application would have 3 types of users: admin, moderator and user. The main business
logic is simple: user will choose a course, watch the content and write an assignment of this course.
If he took the needed percent of the covered course then he chose another one. Otherwise the one
has to rewatch the current course. Moderators at the same time can update course content, add new
courses, or new tasks to the course. Also the moderator should have to add points to the user if
needed. Admin may add new moderators.
